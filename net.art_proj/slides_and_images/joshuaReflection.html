        Joshua's Reflection:
        <br><br>
        The art page by Michael Samyn seemed a little random at first glance. As the "LOVE" was published in 1995, where most people did not have personal computers, I could see how websites evolved to what we have now. The style of not having many words for explaining each page adds a sense of mystery. After getting to "The End", I felt like winning a strategic game.

        Reflection on Love:
        <br><br>
        Love is just like a rollercoaster. It can take you to the highest, the most spectacular heights or drop you to the bottom in seconds. I believe that even with the given risks, love is always worth it. Even though you finished one memorable ride, there are plenty of other rides to take.
