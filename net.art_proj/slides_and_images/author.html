                MICHAEL SAMYN
            </h>
            <p>
                Michael Samyn is a Belgian artist/programmer, who was born in 1968 Belgium.
                <br><br>
                His quote from an interview: "it was difficult to get a place where you could have your work be stored permanently."
                <br><br>
                <strong>Group Z, Belgium </strong>, was a fictional group made from Samyn and his nine artistic alter egos.
                <br><br>
                In 1999, Michael created work with Auriea Harvey under the name Entropy8Zuper!
                <br><br>
                He won multiple awards from art competition and was elected first human Mr.Net Art.
                <br><br>
                Soon, both Michael Samym and Auriea Harvey left net.art and began collaborating together. They both worked for art video games, as they felt the web was becoming too much like a shopping mall.
                <br><br>
                They co-founded the independent development studio, <strong>Tale of Tales</strong>.
                <br><br>
                During a duration of 12 years, they published 8 different games. (The Endless Forest, The Graveyard, The Path, Fatale, Vanitas, Bientot, Luxuria Superbia and Sunset)
                <br><br>
                Work was featured in several exhibitions at key galleries, museums and articles such as <strong>"Hyperallergic"</strong> and the <strong> "New York Times".</strong>
