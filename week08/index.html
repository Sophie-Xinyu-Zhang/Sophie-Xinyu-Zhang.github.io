                In the book <i>The Medium is the Message</i>, Marshall McLuhan described how the
                medium of messages is equally important as the message it contains. Thus, I put a
                light bulb on this page to illustrate that although a electric current is a medium,
                it is capable of providing a space in the darkness for people to read and write.
                Therefore, the nature of medium is more important then the meaning of the message
                because it enables the creation of messages.

                For the name of this website, I named it to be Encrypted Content based on the idea of
                <i>The Medium of Massage</i>. The twist of the word in his writing was meant to grab
                people attention, and that is also what I'm doing here, title the page to have it be
                mysterious and lure people clicking in to see this giant light bulb ;)
