                    - The start of my carving journey goes back all the way 
                    to when I was a elementary school kid. Back then, I read 
                    a blog about rubber carving and was deeply atracted by the 
                    intricacy of the artwork, and created my very first carving 
                    when I was in 4th grade.

                    - After almost ten years since I started carving, it has been 
                    my go-to source whenever I feel stressful. Having the blade 
                    trace through the lines and see the imagery in my mind gradually 
                    come into the reality refreshes me and cures me from anxiety.

                    - On the right side of the screen I put up two pictures of the 
                    carving I made recently. The top one is a carving depicting the 
                    Hogwarts Express, as I'm a Harry Potter fan. The bottom one is 
                    about a little astronut exploring the space, as can see, I'm still 
                    working on it :).
