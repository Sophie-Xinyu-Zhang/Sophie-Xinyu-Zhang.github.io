        The Judgment of Paris; he is sitting at left with Venus, 
        Juno and Pallas Athena, a winged victory above; in the upper
         section the Sun in his chariot preceeded by Castor and Pollux 
         on horseback; at lower right two river gods and a naiad above 
         whom Jupiter, an eagle, Ganymede, Diana and another Goddess.

        Carving is the act of using tools to shape something from a 
        material by scraping away portions of that material. The 
        technique can be applied to any material that is solid enough 
        to hold a form even when pieces have been removed from it, and
         yet soft enough for portions to be scraped away with available
          tools. Carving, as a means for making stone or wooden sculpture, 
          is distinct from methods using soft and malleable materials like 
          clay, fruit, and melted glass, which may be shaped into the desired
           forms while soft and then harden into that form. Carving tends to 
           require much more work than methods using malleable materials.
