                Even though on the image displayed, it is a pipe, it is not a pipe! 
                What you are looking at is an image of a pipe XD. I found this very interesting since 
                it was from a movie I recently watched, and it falls into the idea of <em>Ways of Seeing</em>
                 quite nicely. What you are seeing isn't what you are actually seeing, it's a false copy of it.
                 While it is not a pipe, it does hold the meaning of a pipe...

        <p>And here's a fun little video clip to better explain what I meant</p>
