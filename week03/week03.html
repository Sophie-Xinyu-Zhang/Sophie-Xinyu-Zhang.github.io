        In the article <i>As We May Think</i>, Bushs stated how he imagined the 
        in the future, soem kind of machine would be invented to "compress" the
        scientific knowledge into a more portable form, and thus can be spread in 
        a faster and wider manner. It also predicted many technologies in the modern
        society, such as speech recognition and the World Wide Web.

        Through reading <i>As We May Think</i>, I see how Bushs was ahead of his time 
        by presenting such innovative ideas back in his time. As he said, in order for 
        science to be useful, it is important to allow everyone have access, or be able to, 
        use these science or the product of science in their daily lives.

        Scientists have done tremendous work for this to become a reality. For example, 
        looking around in our houses, we see there's washing machine, there's lamps, there's 
        microwave, and many other electrical appliances. They are all real world applications
         of our knowledge in electricity.

        With the invention of the World Wide Web, people are now able to connect with each other that are thousands of miles away.
        This became especially valuable during the time of a pandemic. I couldn't imagine a world that I stuck inside the house
         without internet. It is internet that we can hear the voices of our family, who might be in the other side of the ocean, 
         and we could see faces that we missed for long.

        Meanwhile, internet fasten and widen the convey of knowledge. With a laptop that has access to internet, a laptop is no longer 
        a laptop, but rather a storage of all the intelligence in the world. Internet granted huge opportunities for people, as the world 
        is now weaved intimately into a net of knowledge. Also, the advancements in internet development helped the scientists as well. 
        Researchers can communicate with each other in the speed of light while they are working on different spots around the globe.
